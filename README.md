# Mess-management-system
The code you provided demonstrates the use of several programming concepts and techniques. Here's a breakdown of the concepts used:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   - The code utilizes classes and objects to organize data and functionality into coherent units.
   - Inheritance is used to create derived classes (`Veg`, `NonVeg`, `Full`, `Mini`) from a base class (`Mess`), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship among classes.

2. Function Overloading:
   - Multiple functions with the same name (`add`) but different parameter lists are defined, demonstrating function overloading.

3. Exception Handling:
   - Exception handling (`try-catch`) is used in the `accept` function to handle invalid input for customer ID and city, ensuring robustness against unexpected user input.

4. File Handling:
   - The program uses file streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`, `fstream`) to read from and write to files, allowing data persistence between program executions.

5. Standard Template Library (STL):
   - The code utilizes the STL map data structure (`std::map`) to associate snack names with their prices, facilitating efficient lookup and retrieval of snack prices.

6. Input-Output Operations:
   - The code employs input-output operations (`cin`, `cout`) to interact with the user, accept input, and display output.

7. Control Structures:
   - Control structures such as `if-else`, `switch-case`, and loops (`for`, `while`) are used to implement conditional logic and iteration.

8. Constructors:
   - The `Mess` class defines a constructor to initialize member variables with default values when an object is created.

9. Encapsulation:
   - Member functions (`accept`, `putdata`) encapsulate operations related to the `Mess` class, hiding the implementation details and providing an interface for interacting with class data.

10. Modularity:
    - The code is divided into smaller, manageable modules such as functions and classes, promoting modularity and improving code organization and maintainability.

These concepts collectively contribute to the structure, functionality, and readability of the program, showcasing fundamental principles of C++ programming.
